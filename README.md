# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

This project demonstrates a simple flow of how user queries are processed using a vector database and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate answers. The architecture follows the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, often used in modern AI-powered applications such as chatbots, search assistants, and document Q&A systems.

## 🔍 Overview

When a user submits a query:

1. The query is transformed into a vector using a **word embedding** model.
2. The vector is used to retrieve similar documents from a **vector database**.
3. The retrieved documents, along with the original query, are passed to a **large language model (LLM)**.
4. The LLM processes this information and returns a **contextual answer**.

## 🧠 Key Components

- **User Query**: The input question or prompt from the user.
- **Word Embedding**: Converts text into high-dimensional vectors for semantic search.
- **Vector Database**: Stores embedded documents and enables similarity-based retrieval.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Uses retrieved context to generate a meaningful answer.
- **Answer**: The final response delivered to the user.
